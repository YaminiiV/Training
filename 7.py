'''
Write a program (function!) that takes a list and returns a new list that contains all the elements of the first list minus all the duplicates.
For this exercise, we will keep track of when our friendâ€™s birthdays are, and be able to find that information based on their name.
Create a dictionary (in your file) of names and birthdays.
When you run your program it should ask the user to enter a name, and return the birthday of that person back to them.
The interaction should look something like this: >>> Welcome to the birthday dictionary.
We know the birthdays of: Albert Einstein Benjamin Franklin Ada Lovelace >>>
Who's birthday do you want to look up? Benjamin Franklin >>> Benjamin Franklin's birthday is 01/17/170
